## Installation ##

### Step 1 ###

Add it on your composer.json

~~~
"fenos/rally": "1.0.*"
~~~

and run **composer update**


### Step 2 ###

Add the following string to **app/config/app.php**

**Providers array:**

~~~
'Fenos\Rally\RallyServiceProvider'
~~~

**Aliases array:**

~~~
'Rally'    => 'Fenos\Rally\Facades\Rally'
~~~

### Step 3 ###

#### Migration ####

Make sure that your settings on **app/config/database.php** are correct, then make the migration typing:

~~~
php artisan migrate --package="fenos/rally"
~~~

### Step 4 ###

#### Include relations ###

Rally comes with some relations already setted for you, you just need to insert the `trait` that I made for you in all your models you wish to have relations with Rally.

~~~

class User extends Eloquent
{
    use \Fenos\Rally\Models\Relations;
}

~~~

That's it your have done.

## Documentation ##

How i said on the installation, Rally can be **Polymorphic**, it means that if you have `Users` and `Teams` as entity of your application they can follow between them. But it is just up to you. If you realize that
you don't need of it, You can keep it as a single model binding.

The key to enable or disable the polymorphic relation is in the configuration files. You just need to push them and change the key polymorphic to `true`.
if instead you want to keep the plugin as 1 model but the `User` model is not your main model change it ;)

~~~
php artisan config:publish fenos/rally
~~~


### Follow ###

For start to be followers of a entity when it comes polymorphically you will use the following method let me show you.

~~~
try
{
    Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->follow('Team',$team_id);
}
catch(\Fenos\Rally\Exceptions\AlreadyFollowerException $e)
{
    // is already fan
}
~~~
With only fews line of code the user has started to follow the team.

If instead you use **Rally** as normal
~~~
try
{
    Rally::follower($user_id)->follow($user_id);
}
catch(\Fenos\Rally\Exceptions\AlreadyFollowerException $e)
{
    // is already follower
}
~~~

Let me explain it. The method `follower()` specify the user that want to be follower, so if Rally comes polymorphically you have to specify as
`first paramter` The model of it, as `second parameter` the id if instead is not polymorphically just the ID.
Almost same the method `follow()` in this method you specify who will be followed parameters are same.

### UnFollow ###

If you don't want follow someone anymore you will use this method:

**Polymorphically**
~~~
try
{
    Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->unFollow('Team',$team_id);
}
catch(\Fenos\Rally\Exceptions\FollowerNotFoundException $e)
{
    // the user already doesn't follow him
}
~~~

**Normal**
~~~
try
{
    Rally::follower($user_id)->unFollow($user_id);
}
catch(\Fenos\Rally\Exceptions\FollowerNotFoundException $e)
{
    // the user already doesn't follow him
}
~~~

### Check if Is follow of ###

If you want to know a given User if has following someone use:

**Polymorphically**
~~~
Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->isFollowerOf('Team',$team_id);
~~~

**Normal**
~~~
Rally::follower($user_id)->isFollowerOf($user_id); // return Boolean
~~~

### Get lists of followers ###

Well Rally give to you a easy way to get the lists of your followers but remeber that you implemented the `trait` with the relations
in your model, So you can even access to them directly from that, I suggest that. But let me show you if you want use Rally.

**Polymorphically**
~~~
Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->getLists();

Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->getLists(['orderBy' => 'DESC', 'limit' => 10]);

Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->getLists(['orderBy' => 'DESC', 'paginate' => 5 ]);
~~~

**Normal**
~~~
Rally::follower($user_id)->getLists();

Rally::follower($user_id)->getLists(['orderBy' => 'DESC', 'limit' => 10]);

Rally::follower($user_id)->getLists(['orderBy' => 'DESC', 'paginate' => 5 ]);
~~~

You can even chain `count()` it return a Collection so you can use all the methods of it.

#### Count Followers ####

You Need just the numbers of followers and nothing else?

**Polymorphically**
~~~
Rally::follower('User',$user_id)->count();
~~~

**Normal**
~~~
Rally::follower($user_id)->count();
~~~

I hope you'll enjoy it.
